/// the developer's own JSON (`aps` plus any app-defined fields such as
/// `deep_link`) and reaches the app byte for byte.
///
/// The value owns three laws, so the CLI, the serve route and the
/// browser panel can't drift on them:
///
/// - **Acceptable payload** — a top-level object carrying an `aps`
///   object, 4096 bytes at most (the APNs limit `simctl push` enforces).
///   Checked here so a malformed payload is named precisely rather than
///   surfacing as simctl's terse refusal.
/// - **Addressee** — the app named explicitly, else the payload's own
///   `Simulator Target Bundle`. Named beats payload, as in simctl.
/// - **What the user will see** — `presentation` / `expectation`.
///   Delivery succeeding only means the simulator took the notification;
///   whether a banner appears depends on `aps`, the app's authorisation
///   and whether it's frontmost. Saying so is the point of the feature.
