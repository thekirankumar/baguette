description: Every HTTP and WebSocket route `baguette serve` answers, one row each, linked to the feature that documents it. Read when calling the server from a script, a plugin or your own page.

# `baguette serve`

```bash
baguette serve                  # http://127.0.0.1:8421/simulators
```

Every flag: [commands.md#baguette-serve](commands.md#baguette-serve). `/simulators` lists devices with Boot / Shutdown; `/simulators/<UDID>` is the focus-mode page (live stream, bezel, toolbar); `/farm` shows every booted device at once ([device-farm](features/device-farm/README.md)).

One resource tree: no `/api/` prefix, the UDID is always in the path, and the format is the file extension.

## Trusted hosts

The server trusts only loopback `Host` / `Origin` values, so a request through a reverse proxy gets `403 forbidden origin`. Trust the proxy's hostname with `--allowed-hosts sim.example.com` (or `'*.example.com'` for subdomains; repeatable, ports ignored). An allowed host is trusted as both `Host` and `Origin`, and allowed origins get CORS headers and preflight answers. Other cross-site origins are still refused. Plugin calls carry their own per-run grant instead — see [plugins](features/plugins/README.md).

## Proxy subpaths

The web UI derives its base from the page URL: `/subpath/simulators`,
`/subpath/simulators/:udid`, `/subpath/devices/:udid` and `/subpath/farm`
keep assets, requests, navigation and WebSockets beneath `/subpath/`.
Nested prefixes work too; no frontend configuration is needed.

To test prefix handling locally without a reverse proxy:

```bash
baguette serve --rootpath /subpath
open http://127.0.0.1:8421/subpath/simulators
```

This mounts every HTTP and WebSocket route beneath the supplied path. Both
`/subpath` and `/subpath/` redirect to the mounted list; unprefixed routes are
not served. A trailing slash on the option is accepted, and the default `/`
keeps existing URLs unchanged. Prefixes must be literal URL paths, without
query strings, captures or empty/dot segments.

JSON definitions retain their server-root asset paths; the built-in UI resolves
them beneath the detected mount. Custom API clients must apply the same base.

Configure your reverse proxy to:

- Strip the prefix upstream: `/subpath/devices.json` becomes `/devices.json`.
- Forward WebSocket upgrades on prefixed stream, log and camera routes.
- Rewrite upstream `Location` redirects to retain the prefix, including the
  `/` redirect to `/simulators`; redirect `/subpath` to `/subpath/`.
- Use a [trusted hostname](#trusted-hosts). Keep authentication at the proxy;
  allowed hosts are an origin check, not user authentication.

These stripping instructions assume the default `--rootpath /`. If the server
itself uses `--rootpath /subpath`, forward that prefix unchanged instead.

For an SDK embedded in a different page, explicitly supply the server base,
including its mount: `Baguette.use({ host: 'https://sim.example.com/subpath/', udid, send })`.
The built-in pages detect it automatically.

## One WebSocket per stream

`WS /simulators/:udid/stream` carries a whole viewing session in both directions:

- **Server → page**: one binary message per encoded frame. MJPEG sends raw JPEG bytes. AVCC sends a 1-byte tag then the payload: `0x01` avcC description (feed to `VideoDecoder.configure`), `0x02` keyframe, `0x03` delta, `0x04` JPEG seed that paints before the first H.264 keyframe lands. Text messages come back for `*_result` replies and a foldable's `hinge` samples.
- **Page → server**: text JSON, one message each — stream control (`set_bitrate`, `set_fps`, `set_scale`, `force_idr`, `snapshot`) and gestures, both in [wire.md](wire.md).

There is no `/event` side route and no UDID-keyed registry: the socket owns the stream and the simulator handle for as long as it is open. Closing it stops the capture.

## Editing the UI without rebuilding

The page is plain HTML and JS under `Sources/Baguette/Resources/Web/`. Point `BAGUETTE_WEB_DIR` at that folder and reload the browser to see edits without rebuilding:

```bash
BAGUETTE_WEB_DIR=Sources/Baguette/Resources/Web baguette serve
```

Why the server is shaped this way — thin handlers, no templating, the plugin grant check — is in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#server-route-surface).
