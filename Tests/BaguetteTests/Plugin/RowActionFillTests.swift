/// `rowAction: "fill"` — a row that puts its text into the panel's own
/// prompt instead of doing something with it.
///
/// The other four actions all *act*: box a frame, tap it, copy it, run a
/// command. This one hands the row to the field above it, which is what
/// a list of suggestions under a text box has always meant. The
/// deep-link panel is the case that named it: clicking `account://` was
/// opening a bare scheme with no path, when what anyone wants is that
/// scheme in the box with the caret after it, ready for the rest of the
/// URL.
///
/// So the list stops being a launcher and becomes what it looks like —
/// completion.
