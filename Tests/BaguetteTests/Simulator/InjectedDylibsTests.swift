///
/// The problem this value exists to solve: that env var is **one string
/// for the whole simulator**, and baguette now has more than one feature
/// that wants a dylib inside apps (the virtual camera, and motion). The
/// old code wrote a single path and unset the whole variable on teardown,
/// so a second feature arming would silently disarm the first, and either
/// one stopping would disarm the other.
///
/// Merging is modelled as a value so the arithmetic is tested here and the
/// adapter stays a thin read-modify-write around `launchctl`.
