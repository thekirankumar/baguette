/// The device never tells us what it's doing; a walk vector does. The
/// browser's Walk mode already asks the question in the user's language —
/// its speed presets are `Walk 1.4 · Run 3.5 · Cycle 6 · Drive 13.4 ·
/// Highway 29` (m/s) — so the classification is pinned to those presets
/// rather than invented. If a preset ever stops classifying as its own
/// label, the thresholds have drifted and these tests say so.
///
/// The frontend stays a dumb sender: it keeps posting the same walk
/// vector it always did, and the speed is classified here.
