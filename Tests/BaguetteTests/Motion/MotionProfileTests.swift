/// The split this type exists to enforce: **policy lives here, in tested
/// Swift; the dylib only does arithmetic.** It cannot be the other way
/// round — a pedometer must accumulate monotonically and `CMMotionManager`
/// delivers at up to 100 Hz, so neither can be streamed from the host.
/// The host publishes the constants; the dylib integrates them.
