import PackageDescription

// SimulatorKit + CoreSimulator are deliberately NOT linked here. Nothing
// in Sources/ does `import SimulatorKit` / `import CoreSimulator` — the
// Swift code reaches into them via `NSClassFromString` + `dlsym` (see
// `CoreSimulators.loadFrameworks()` and `IndigoHIDInput.warmUp()`),
// after discovering the active Xcode through `xcode-select -p`.
//
// Linking them at build time would bake LC_LOAD_DYLIB entries that dyld
// must resolve before `main()` runs, which fails for users whose Xcode
// lives anywhere other than `/Applications/Xcode.app` (issue #1). The
// runtime dlopen path already handles every install location correctly.
